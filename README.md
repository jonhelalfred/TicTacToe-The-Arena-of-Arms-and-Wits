# TicTacToe-The-Arena-of-Arms-and-Wits
Welcome to TicTacToe: The Arena of Arms and Wits! This version is inspired by the traditional Tic Tac Toe but introduces new mechanics to make the gameplay more engaging and strategic. Players take on roles as either the Offense or Defense, using distinct icons --🗡️ for offense and 🛡️ for defense. The objective is to be the first to win 3 rounds first (Best of 5). In each round, the Offensive Player goes first, followed by the Defensive Player. The Offensive Player wins a round by forming a 3-in-a-row pattern, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The Defensive Player wins a round by blocking the Offensive Player from forming a 3-in-a-row pattern. If the Offensive Player is unable to form this pattern, the Defensive Player wins the round.

A unique twist in the game is that if the Defensive Player forms a 3-in-a-row pattern, the round ends in a draw. The Defensive Player’s primary goal is to prevent the Offensive Player from scoring, not to form a 3-in-a-row pattern themselves. The game continues until one player wins 3 rounds, at which point they are declared the winner.
